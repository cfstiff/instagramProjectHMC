Assignment for CS121 at Harvey Mudd College. For this assignment, we had to create an instagram-esque site in Ruby on Rails, following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE).

(Brief note to any HMC students who may be working on this assignment in the future - reading this code would count as a violation of the honor code! Do the assignment correctly.)

The main functionality of the site was as follows:

A sign up page:

A log in page:

A way to add new images with descriptions:

A way to view all images that had been added to the site, and a logout button:

This assignment would not have been at all possible without many different StackOverflow questions and the grutor troubleshooting document.
